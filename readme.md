## Overview

**Project Title**: Calculator

**Project Description**: A calculator that solves basic arithmic and trig equations. It is built in Kotlin and in xml files.

**Project Goals**: The goal of this project was to learn the basics of kotlin and create an android app that works.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. You will need an android phone or an emulator for one.
2. You can load the files through android studio and when you have a phone or emulator connected to it
3. You will then click play in the top right of android studio.

Instructions for using the software:

1. When the emulator or phone is connected the app will load when you press play.
2. The calculator is able to detect if you are adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing. Just enter the equation you want and it will pop out the answer.
3. The trig functions aren't working yet.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* You will need Android Studio, mine is the newest one which is called JellyFish
* You will need the newest version of JavaJDK which is 22
* You will need to create a phone emulator or connect your own android phone to run the program.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Fix the trig functions. I want to make sure the calculator detects that a trig function is entered and is able to return the correct answer in radians.
* [ ] Because the trig function isn't working, the multiple and divide buttons aren't working so i need to fix that too.
* [ ] I want to add more possible functions like squaring or whatever you want to use an exponent or absolute values.
